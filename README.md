# ASE-PROJECT
We have planned to make a mobile application to help the new immigrants especially students with their basic needs. Therefore, we propose a plan to avail all services on one platform by installing smart software.  In this project, we have planned to provide two different modules. 

1. High priority features
High priority features include search of accommodation, FAQâ€™s, finding nearby medical stores and a special feature to have in-city ride shares.                                    
2. Medium to Low priority feature
Medium to low priority features include giving necessary details for services like SIN, SIM, search of part-time.
